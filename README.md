# SkySim5000 GW pipeline

The portable pipeline starts from an existing HDF5 catalogue of possible seed hosts, then samples GW injections, computes O5-network detection and GWDALI localisation, and builds HEALPix maps. It does not need the original heavy SkySim5000 catalogue, GCRCatalogs, or MPI. Optional upstream tools retain the merger-rate calculation and NERSC-only SkySim5000 seed-host assignment. The code is now separated into reusable modules, production stages, diagnostics, and settings. Existing NERSC paths and scientific defaults are preserved.

## Start here

```bash
# Run from this directory; scientific dependencies are unnecessary for these commands.
python3 -m skysim_gw --list
python3 -m skysim_gw --dry-run snr
```

Read [the pipeline guide](docs/PIPELINE.md) for execution order, configuration, portability, and known missing inputs. The [scientific methodology](docs/METHODOLOGY.md) explains the analysis and product conventions.

Set `SOURCE_FILE` in `skysim_gw/settings/population.py` to the exported seed-host HDF5, then start with:

```bash
python -m skysim_gw prepare
```

The existing path remains a placeholder. See the pipeline guide for the required HDF5 schema. `assign-hosts` is only for rebuilding that file at NERSC; skip it and `rate-targets` when reusing existing seeds.

```

The obsolete root-level entry points now live in `legacy/`; use the package launcher for calculations. Edit implementations inside `skysim_gw/` and configuration inside `skysim_gw/settings/`. All diagnosers remain active in `skysim_gw/diagnostics/`. The empty `legacy/merge_gwdali_doublet_samples.py` remains an unimplemented placeholder. See [the archive notes](legacy/README.md) for compatibility usage.

## Import reusable code

In the scientific environment:

```python
from skysim_gw.rates import expected_events_in_bin
from skysim_gw.population import PopulationConfig, prepare_population
from skysim_gw.catalogue import load_gwdali_catalogue, get_gwdali_source
from skysim_gw.detectors import get_lvk_detectors
from skysim_gw.results import find_matrix, unwrap_gwdali_result
```

Importing these modules does not launch catalogue calculations. Individual modules still require their scientific dependencies; importing the top-level package and listing stages does not.

## Provenance and validation

`source_XXXXXX.npz` identifies original **prepared-catalogue row XXXXXX**, even after detection filtering. Match catalogues using `source_index`; assign GW redshift slices using injected `redshift_true`. Preserve the distinction between Fisher covariance maps and maps of actual Doublet posterior samples.

The original scripts were tested end-to-end on NERSC by the author. This refactor has passed syntax and eight structural checks locally, plus a comparison confirming preserved extracted settings and 115 unchanged function/class syntax trees. It has **not** been numerically revalidated: this machine lacks NumPy, Astropy, h5py, healpy, and GWDALI.

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 -m compileall -q skysim_gw tests
```
